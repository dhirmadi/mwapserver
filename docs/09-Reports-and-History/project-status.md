### Vision
Create a world-class platform that enables developers to build secure, scalable, cloud-integrated applications with AI capabilities while maintaining strict security standards and excellent developer experience.

### Core Principles
- **Security First**: Zero-trust architecture with comprehensive security measures
- **Multi-Tenant**: Complete tenant isolation with role-based access control
- **Cloud Integration**: Native integration with major cloud providers
- **AI-Ready**: Built-in support for AI agent frameworks and intelligent services
- **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive documentation and tooling
- **Scalability**: Designed for enterprise-scale deployments

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Version | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|---------|
| **Runtime** | Node.js | 20+ | Server runtime environment |
| **Language** | TypeScript | 5.x | Type-safe development |
| **Framework** | Express.js | 4.x | Web application framework |
| **Database** | MongoDB Atlas | 6.0+ | Primary data storage |
| **Validation** | Zod | 3.x | Schema validation and type inference |
| **Authentication** | Auth0 | - | JWT authentication (RS256, JWKS) |
| **Testing** | Vitest | 1.x | Unit and integration testing |
| **Deployment** | Heroku/Docker | - | Cloud deployment platform |

### Architecture Principles
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Modular architecture organized by business domains (`/features/{domain}`)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Thin controllers, fat services pattern
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Centralized middleware and utilities
- **Schema-First Validation**: Zod schemas drive API validation and TypeScript types
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Consistent error handling via `errors.ts` + `response.ts`
- **Security by Default**: Authentication and authorization enforced at every level

### API Design Standards
- **RESTful APIs**: Consistent REST patterns across all endpoints
- **JWT Authentication**: Auth0 JWT tokens with role-based access control
- **Tenant Isolation**: Complete data isolation between tenants
- **Role-Based Access**: Hierarchical permissions (SuperAdmin > Tenant Owner > Project Owner/Deputy/Member)
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all operations
- **Error Consistency**: Standardized error responses and codes
