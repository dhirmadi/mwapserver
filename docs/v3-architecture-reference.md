# 🏗️ MWAP Backend API Architecture Reference

## 🎯 Purpose

This document defines the **backend API server architecture** for MWAP as a general reference. It is intended to serve as the canonical reference for developers and scaffolding tools during backend generation, to understand this repository, the domain model it implements, and the coding principles it enforces.

---

## 🤖 Using with OpenHands
* It is intended to serve as the canonical reference for developers and scaffolding tools during backend generation.
* All scaffolding tasks (routes, services, schemas) should reference this as source of truth
* Tools must not generate its own folder structures or role logic — only reuse what’s defined here

---

## 🚀 Scope

* Focus: Backend API only
* Frontend UI, deployments, and CI/CD are out of scope for this reference (but available in supporting docs)

---

## 🧱 Architectural Overview

### 1. **Domain-Driven Design**

* All modules map 1:1 to core domain entities: `Tenant`, `Project`, `ProjectType`, `CloudProvider`, etc.
* Each domain has a folder under `src/features/{domain}`

### 2. **Stack**

* **Runtime**: Node.js (v18+)
* **Web framework**: Express.js
* **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (Mongoose ODM)
* **Auth**: Auth0 JWT (RS256, JWKS)
* **Schema Validation**: Zod

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
/src
  /features
    /tenants              → tenant logic, routes, services
    /projects             → project logic and member APIs
    /project-types        → project type management and configuration schemas
    /integrations         → cloud provider integrations (OAuth)
    /cloud                → file listing, metadata, and sorting
  /middleware             → auth, role, request validation
  /services               → reusable pure services across domains
  /schemas                → Zod schema definitions for all types
  /utils                  → helper methods (e.g. token tools)
  /config                 → env loading, Auth0, Mongo connection
```

---

## 📜 Coding Guidelines

### 🔹 Language & Style

* TypeScript for type safety (migrating from JS where needed)
* ES modules (no `require`, use `import`)
* Functional-first service layer (no `this`, no mutation)

### 🔸 Patterns

* **Thin Controllers**, **Fat Services**
* **Zod for all external inputs** (request body, query, Claude input)
* All Express routes must attach role middleware where applicable

### 🔐 Security

* All routes require `Bearer` token (Auth0)
* Route permissions enforced via `verifyProjectRole` or `requireRoles`

---

## 🧪 Testing

* Use `vitest` for unit tests
* All routes must have input validation tests + role enforcement tests

---

## 🔧 MWAP Shared Utilities Overview

This docchapter describes the shared utility modules in `src/utils/`. These services provide **common functionality** needed across multiple features (e.g. tenants, projects, integrations), and must be used consistently by all controllers, services, and OpenHands-generated code.

---

### 📁 Directory Structure

```bash
src/utils/
├── auth.ts         # Auth-related helpers (roles, token parsing)
├── errors.ts       # Error types and standard exception helpers
├── logger.ts       # Application logging interface
├── response.ts     # Standardized HTTP JSON response helpers
├── validate.ts     # Zod validation and schema enforcement
```

---

### 🔐 `auth.ts`

```ts
export function getUserFromToken(req: Request): { sub: string; email: string; name: string }
export function requireTenantRole(role: 'OWNER' | 'MEMBER'): MiddlewareFn
export function requireProjectRole(role: 'OWNER' | 'DEPUTY' | 'MEMBER'): MiddlewareFn
```

---

### ⚠️ `errors.ts`

```ts
export class ApiError extends Error {
  status: number;
  constructor(message: string, status?: number)
}
export class NotFoundError extends ApiError {}
export class PermissionError extends ApiError {}
export function wrapHandler(fn: Fn): Fn  // wraps async controller
```

---

### 🪵 `logger.ts`

```ts
export function logInfo(message: string, meta?: any): void
export function logError(message: string, error?: any): void
export function logAudit(action: string, actor: string, target: string, meta?: any): void
```

---

### 📦 `response.ts`

```ts
export function jsonResponse(res: Response, data: any, status = 200): void
export function errorResponse(res: Response, err: Error): void
export function wrapAsyncHandler(fn: Fn): Fn
```

---

### ✅ `validate.ts`

```ts
export function validateWithSchema<T>(schema: ZodSchema<T>, input: unknown): T
```

---

### 🧠 OpenHands Usage

* Claude should **reuse these utilities** when generating any controller or middleware.
* No direct calls to `res.json()` or `console.error()` should occur in feature modules — they must go through `response.ts` or `logger.ts`.
* Error classes help with consistent error formatting, logging, and status codes.

---

## 🔐 MWAP Middleware Design and Structure

This document defines the organization and purpose of middleware in the MWAP backend server. All middleware functions live under `src/middleware/` and are categorized by their security, role-checking, and request pre-processing responsibilities.

---

### 📁 Folder Structure

```bash
/src/middleware
├── auth.ts          # JWT validation via Auth0 (sets req.user)
├── cors.ts          # Centralized CORS policy enforcement
├── roles.ts         # Role-based access control (project, tenant)
├── rateLimiter.ts   # Optional request throttling per IP
├── secureHeaders.ts # Helmet and header hardening (optional)
```

---

### 🔐 `auth.ts`

```ts
export function authenticateJWT(): RequestHandler // Sets req.user
```

* Validates JWT from `Authorization` header
* Verifies via Auth0 JWKS endpoint (RS256)
* Populates `req.user = { sub, email, name }`

---

### 🌐 `cors.ts`

```ts
export const corsMiddleware: RequestHandler
```

* Uses `cors` package
* Reads from allowed origins via config
* Supports credentials and custom headers

---

### 🛡️ `roles.ts`

```ts
export function requireProjectRole(...roles: Role[]): RequestHandler
export function requireTenantRole(...roles: Role[]): RequestHandler
```

* Middleware to guard routes based on user's role in current scope
* Roles: `OWNER`, `DEPUTY`, `MEMBER`
* Relies on `req.user` populated by `auth.ts`

---

### 🚦 `rateLimiter.ts` *(optional)*

```ts
export const rateLimiter: RequestHandler
```

* Uses `express-rate-limit`
* Protects login, webhook, or agent-triggered routes from abuse

---

### 🧯 `secureHeaders.ts` *(optional)*

```ts
export const applySecureHeaders: RequestHandler
```

* Uses `helmet` to apply:

  * Content-Security-Policy
  * Referrer-Policy
  * Strict-Transport-Security
  * X-Frame-Options

---

### 🧠 OpenHands Usage

* Middleware must be reused, not redefined inline in controllers
* Claude must use `authenticateJWT()` and `requireProjectRole()` rather than parsing tokens manually
* All exposed routes must apply at least one middleware from this set

---

## 🧠 MWAP Services Structure

The `src/services/` folder contains reusable, pure business logic that is shared across multiple features. These services coordinate validation, permissions, and access logic outside of specific controllers or HTTP routing.

---

### 📁 Folder Layout

```bash
/src/services/
├── auditLogger.ts      # Tracks actions performed across tenants/projects
├── projectAccess.ts    # Validates project access and member role enforcement
├── tenantContext.ts    # Loads tenant and user context from decoded token
```

---

### 🔍 File Descriptions

#### `auditLogger.ts`

```ts
export function logAudit(action: string, userId: string, target: string, meta?: any): void
```

* Captures who did what to which entity (e.g. "user X archived project Y")
* May write to a database, file log, or monitoring service

#### `projectAccess.ts`

```ts
export async function assertProjectAccess(projectId: string, userId: string, allowedRoles: Role[]): Promise<Project>
```

* Fetches project from DB
* Validates user is a member with a permitted role
* Throws `PermissionError` if check fails

#### `tenantContext.ts`

```ts
export async function resolveTenantContext(userSub: string): Promise<Tenant>
```

* Maps Auth0 `sub` → internal user and tenant
* Returns full `Tenant` object with relevant metadata

---

## ⚙️ MWAP Config Module

All runtime configuration (environment, database, Auth0 keys) is loaded via:

```bash
/src/config/
├── env.ts          # dotenv-based environment variable loader
├── db.ts           # Mongoose connection
├── auth0.ts        # JWKS client setup
```

---

### 🧠 Claude / OpenHands Notes

* Always reuse these services for access checks and tenant resolution
* Never duplicate project role validation inside controllers
* Do not access Express `req/res` inside any service file
* Services may throw `ApiError` subclasses (see `utils/errors.ts`)
