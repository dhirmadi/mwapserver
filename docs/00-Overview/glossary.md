# üìö MWAP Glossary

## üéØ Core Concepts

### **MWAP (Modular Web Application Platform)**
A secure, scalable SaaS framework built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas, and Auth0. Designed for multi-tenant applications with role-based access control and progressive enhancement capabilities.

### **Multi-Tenancy**
Architecture pattern where a single application instance serves multiple customers (tenants) while maintaining complete data isolation and customization capabilities.

### **Zero Trust Security**
Security model that requires verification for every user and device, regardless of location. All API endpoints require authentication and authorization validation.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Terms

### **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
Architectural approach where code organization mirrors business domains. Each feature (tenants, projects, users) has its own dedicated folder structure.

### **Feature-Based Structure**
Code organization pattern where related functionality is grouped by business feature rather than technical layer:
```
src/features/tenants/     # All tenant-related code
src/features/projects/    # All project-related code
src/features/users/       # All user-related code
```

### **Progressive Enhancement**
Development approach where core functionality works universally, with advanced features added as layers. Cloud providers and integrations are added dynamically.

### **API Gateway**
Central entry point for all API requests, handling authentication, rate limiting, and request routing through Express.js and NGINX.

## üîí Security & Authentication

### **Auth0**
Third-party authentication service providing JWT tokens, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and OAuth integrations with PKCE flow.

### **JWT (JSON Web Token)**
Secure token format used for authentication. MWAP uses RS256 algorithm with JWKS endpoint validation for maximum security.

### **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**
Authorization system where permissions are assigned to roles, and roles are assigned to users. Supports tenant-level and project-level permissions.

### **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)**
OAuth 2.0 security extension that prevents authorization code interception attacks, especially important for single-page applications.

### **JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)**
Public key set used to verify JWT token signatures. Retrieved from Auth0's well-known endpoint for token validation.

## üë• User Management

### **Tenant**
Primary organizational unit in MWAP. Each tenant represents a customer organization with isolated data, users, and projects.

### **Tenant Owner**
User with full administrative privileges within a tenant, including user management, project creation, and billing access.

### **Project Member**
User with specific role-based permissions within a project. Roles include Admin, Developer, and Viewer with different access levels.

### **Super Admin**
System-level administrator with access to all tenants and system configuration. Used for platform maintenance and support.

## üöÄ Development & Deployment

### **ESM (ES Modules)**
Native JavaScript module system used throughout MWAP. All imports/exports use modern ES module syntax.

### **TypeScript Strict Mode**
TypeScript configuration with strict type checking enabled. No implicit `any` types allowed, ensuring type safety.

### **Microagents**
AI-powered development assistants built on OpenHands platform. Specialized agents for planning, building, reviewing, and documenting code.

### **OpenHands**
AI development platform providing intelligent code generation, review, and documentation capabilities integrated into MWAP workflow.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database & Storage

### **MongoDB Atlas**
Cloud-hosted MongoDB service providing scalable document database with built-in security and backup features.

### **Field-Level Encryption**
MongoDB feature encrypting sensitive data fields at the database level, providing additional security layer beyond application encryption.

### **Mongoose ODM**
Object Document Mapper for MongoDB, providing schema validation, middleware, and query building capabilities.

### **Document Database**
NoSQL database model storing data as flexible JSON-like documents, ideal for multi-tenant applications with varying data structures.

## üîß Technical Components

### **Express.js**
Web application framework for Node.js providing routing, middleware, and HTTP utilities for building REST APIs.

### **Zod**
TypeScript-first schema validation library ensuring runtime type safety for API requests and responses.

### **Helmet**
Security middleware for Express.js adding various HTTP headers to protect against common vulnerabilities.

### **Rate Limiting**
Security mechanism preventing abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP within a time window.

## üåê Integration & Cloud

### **Cloud Provider**
External service integration (AWS, Azure, GCP) managed through MWAP's cloud provider abstraction layer.

### **OAuth Integration**
Secure authentication flow allowing users to connect external services (GitHub, Google, etc.) to their MWAP projects.

### **Project Type**
Template or configuration defining the structure and capabilities of projects within MWAP (e.g., web app, API, mobile).

### **Virtual Files**
File management system allowing projects to reference and manipulate files across different cloud storage providers.

## üìä API & Communication

### **REST API**
Representational State Transfer architecture for web services. MWAP provides RESTful endpoints for all operations.

### **OpenAPI Schema**
Standardized specification describing REST API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

### **API Versioning**
System for managing API changes over time. MWAP uses URL-based versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`).

### **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
Security feature controlling which domains can access MWAP APIs from web browsers.

## üß™ Testing & Quality

### **Unit Testing**
Testing individual functions or components in isolation using frameworks like Jest or Vitest.

### **Integration Testing**
Testing interactions between different components, especially API endpoints and database operations.

### **Validation Testing**
Ensuring all inputs are properly validated using Zod schemas before processing.

### **Security Testing**
Automated testing of authentication, authorization, and input validation to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## üìà Performance & Monitoring

### **Caching**
Temporary storage of frequently accessed data to improve application performance and reduce database load.

### **Connection Pooling**
Database optimization technique maintaining a pool of reusable database connections to improve performance.

### **Error Handling**
Centralized system for capturing, logging, and responding to application errors using AppError class.

### **Logging**
Systematic recording of application events, errors, and performance metrics for debugging and monitoring.

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### **Feature Branch Workflow**
Git branching strategy where new features are developed in separate branches before merging to main.

### **Conventional Commits**
Standardized commit message format enabling automated changelog generation and semantic versioning.

### **Pull Request (PR)**
Code review process where changes are reviewed and approved before merging into main branch.

### **Continuous Integration (CI)**
Automated testing and validation of code changes on every commit or pull request.

## üìö Documentation

### **API Documentation**
Comprehensive documentation of all API endpoints, including request/response examples and authentication requirements.

### **Architecture Documentation**
High-level system design documentation explaining component relationships and data flows.

### **Developer Onboarding**
Structured process and documentation for new developers to become productive quickly.

### **Changelog**
Chronological record of all changes, improvements, and bug fixes in each version release.
