# Guides Directory Cleanup Summary

**Date:** 2024-10-01  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## 🧹 What Was Cleaned

### Files Moved to Archive

The following temporary review and completion documents were moved to `archive/`:

1. **`COMPLETE-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`** - OAuth implementation completion report
2. **`FRONTEND-DEVELOPER-REVIEW.md`** - Critical review document identifying documentation gaps
3. **`FRONTEND-REVIEW-SUMMARY.md`** - Before/after metrics summary
4. **`IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`** - Implementation recommendations summary

**Reason:** These are completion reports and review documents from the OAuth documentation overhaul, not ongoing guides. Their recommendations have been implemented in current guides.
