## üìã Archived Documents

### OAuth Documentation Consolidation (2024-10-01)

These documents were consolidated to reduce fragmentation and redundancy:

#### Reference Documents (Moved to Archive)
- **`oauth-troubleshooting-guide.md`** (809 lines) - Comprehensive troubleshooting reference
- **`oauth-security-guide.md`** (604 lines) - Implementation-specific security guide  
- **`FRONTEND_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** (215 lines) - Frontend PKCE quick reference

**Why archived:**
- **Troubleshooting guide**: 809 lines of reference material better suited as searchable reference than primary guide
- **Security guide**: Implementation details merged into main security guide; detailed code examples preserved here
- **PKCE quick ref**: Content should be integrated into main frontend guide

**Replacements:**
- General OAuth: [oauth-integration-guide.md](../oauth-integration-guide.md)
- Security: [oauth-security.md](../oauth-security.md)
- Frontend: [oauth-frontend-complete-guide.md](../oauth-frontend-complete-guide.md)
- Backend PKCE: [pkce-implementation-guide.md](../pkce-implementation-guide.md)

### Review & Implementation Reports

These documents were created during the OAuth documentation overhaul:

- **`COMPLETE-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`** - OAuth documentation improvements summary
- **`FRONTEND-DEVELOPER-REVIEW.md`** - Critical review identifying gaps
- **`FRONTEND-REVIEW-SUMMARY.md`** - Before/after metrics
- **`IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`** - Implementation recommendations  
- **`IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md`** - Completion tracking
- **`OAUTH-GUIDE-REVIEW-ISSUES.md`** - Issues list
- **`CLEANUP-SUMMARY.md`** - Guide cleanup summary

**Why archived:** Completion reports, not ongoing guides.

---

### Superseded Documentation

- **`oauth-integration-guide-old.md`** - Old version of OAuth integration guide

**Why archived:** Superseded by current implementation-accurate guide.

## üîç When to Reference Archive

**Use these documents when:**
- Understanding the history of documentation improvements
- Reviewing what issues were identified and resolved
- Learning from the review process for future documentation work
- Understanding the rationale behind current guide structure

**Don't use these for:**
- Current implementation guidance (use parent directory guides)
- Production development work
- Onboarding new developers
