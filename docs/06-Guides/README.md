### Updating Guides
When updating these guides:
1. **Keep consolidation**: Add related content to existing guides rather than creating new files
2. **Maintain structure**: Follow the established guide organization patterns
3. **Cross-reference**: Link between guides when topics overlap
4. **Test examples**: Ensure all code examples are tested and working

### Legacy Files
The `archive/` folder contains the original fragmented files for:
