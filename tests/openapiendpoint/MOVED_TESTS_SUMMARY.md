# Test Scripts Migration Summary

## ✅ Successfully Moved Test Scripts to `/tests/openapiendpoint/`

All OpenAPI endpoint test scripts have been successfully moved from various locations in the `src/` directory to the organized `/tests/openapiendpoint/` folder.

### 📁 Files Moved

| Original Location | New Location | Status |
|------------------|--------------|--------|
| `src/test-phase4-simple.ts` | `tests/openapiendpoint/test-phase4-simple.ts` | ✅ Moved |
| `src/test-phase4-integration.ts` | `tests/openapiendpoint/test-phase4-integration.ts` | ✅ Moved |
| `src/test-phase5-advanced.ts` | `tests/openapiendpoint/test-phase5-advanced.ts` | ✅ Moved |
| `src/features/openapi/test-feature.ts` | `tests/openapiendpoint/test-feature.ts` | ✅ Moved |
| `src/services/openapi/test-services.ts` | `tests/openapiendpoint/test-services.ts` | ✅ Moved |

### 🔧 Import Path Updates

All import paths have been updated to use the correct relative paths from the new location:
- Changed from `import('./...)` to `import('../../src/...')`
- Updated both static imports and dynamic imports
- Verified all imports resolve correctly

### 📋 New Test Organization

```
tests/openapiendpoint/
├── README.md                    # Test documentation
├── run-all-tests.ts            # Test runner script
├── test-services.ts            # Core service tests
├── test-feature.ts             # Feature module tests
├── test-phase4-simple.ts       # Simple integration tests
├── test-phase4-integration.ts  # Full integration tests
└── test-phase5-advanced.ts     # Advanced feature tests
```

### 🚀 NPM Scripts Added

New test scripts added to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:openapi": "tsx tests/openapiendpoint/run-all-tests.ts",
    "test:openapi:services": "tsx tests/openapiendpoint/test-services.ts",
    "test:openapi:feature": "tsx tests/openapiendpoint/test-feature.ts",
    "test:openapi:integration": "tsx tests/openapiendpoint/test-phase4-integration.ts",
    "test:openapi:advanced": "tsx tests/openapiendpoint/test-phase5-advanced.ts"
  }
}
```

### ✅ Verification

All tests have been verified to work correctly from their new locations:
- ✅ Import paths resolve correctly
- ✅ All services and modules load properly
- ✅ Test execution completes successfully
- ✅ NPM scripts work as expected

### 🧹 Cleanup

- ✅ All test files removed from `src/` directory
- ✅ No orphaned test files remaining
- ✅ Clean separation between source code and tests
- ✅ Proper test organization following best practices

## Usage

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm run test:openapi
```

### Run Individual Test Suites
```bash
npm run test:openapi:services     # Core services
npm run test:openapi:feature      # Feature module
npm run test:openapi:integration  # Integration tests
npm run test:openapi:advanced     # Advanced features
```

### Direct Execution
```bash
npx tsx tests/openapiendpoint/test-services.ts
```

This migration improves code organization, follows testing best practices, and makes the test suite more maintainable and discoverable.
